- **Outputs:** Clarify what the expected outputs should be.

### 3. **Think Aloud**

- **Communicate Your Thought Process:** Share your understanding of the problem with the interviewer. This helps them see your approach and reasoning.

### 4. **Outline a Plan**

- **Discuss Possible Approaches:** Talk through different ways to solve the problem, including brute-force methods and more optimized solutions.
- **Choose an Approach:** Select the best method based on efficiency and clarity.

### 5. **Write Pseudocode**

- **Outline Your Solution:** Write pseudocode or a high-level outline of your algorithm. This helps organize your thoughts before coding.

### 6. **Code the Solution**

- **Implement the Algorithm:** Write the actual code based on your pseudocode. Keep it clean and organized.
- **Handle Edge Cases:** Consider and address any edge cases or exceptions in your implementation.

### 7. **Test Your Solution**

- **Run Through Test Cases:** Use both provided and custom test cases to validate your solution.
- **Check for Edge Cases:** Ensure your code handles edge cases, such as empty inputs or large values.

### 8. **Optimize (if necessary)**

- **Analyze Complexity:** Discuss the time and space complexity of your solution. Consider whether it can be optimized further.

### 9. **Review Your Code**

- **Check for Errors:** Quickly review your code for any syntax errors or logical mistakes.
- **Explain Your Code:** Be prepared to explain how your code works, especially if asked to clarify or walk through specific parts.

### 10. **Be Open to Feedback**

- **Receive Guidance:** If the interviewer suggests changes or hints at improvements, be open to feedback and willing to adjust your approach.

By following these steps, you can structure your problem-solving process and demonstrate your thought process clearly, making a positive impression on your interviewer.
