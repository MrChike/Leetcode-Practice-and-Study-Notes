- **Space Complexity:** Discuss additional memory usage (arrays, recursion depth, hash tables).  

#### **How to Structure Your Complexity Explanation**  
**Example Phrases to Use:**  
- *"The time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once."*  
- *"The space complexity is O(1) since we use only a few extra variables."*  
- *"Since we divide the input in half at each step, the time complexity is O(log n)."*  

#### **Golden Rules**  
âœ… Compare solutions and justify choices.  
âœ… Focus on worst-case complexity.  
âœ… Keep explanations **concise and structured**.

Absolutely! Below is a breakdown of each time complexity with its **name** and an accompanying **Python code example** to demonstrate the concept.

### 1. **O(1) â€“ Constant Time**
   - **Meaning**: The algorithm takes a constant amount of time, regardless of the size of the input.
   - **Example**: Accessing an element in an array by index.

   ```python
   def get_element(arr, index):
       return arr[index]

   # Example usage
   arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
   print(get_element(arr, 2))  # Constant time access
   ```

   - **Time Complexity**: **O(1)**

   **Explanation**: Accessing an element by index in an array takes the same amount of time regardless of the array's size.

---

### 2. **O(log n) â€“ Logarithmic Time**
   - **Meaning**: The algorithm's time grows logarithmically with the input size. Typically, this happens when the problem is divided into smaller chunks in each step.
   - **Example**: **Binary search**.

   ```python
   def binary_search(arr, target):
       left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
       while left <= right:
           mid = (left + right) // 2
           if arr[mid] == target:
               return mid
           elif arr[mid] < target:
               left = mid + 1
           else:
               right = mid - 1
       return -1

   # Example usage
   arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
   print(binary_search(arr, 5))  # Logarithmic time search
   ```

   - **Time Complexity**: **O(log n)**

   **Explanation**: The search space is halved in each iteration, so it takes logarithmic time to find an element.

---

### 3. **O(n) â€“ Linear Time**
   - **Meaning**: The algorithmâ€™s time grows linearly with the input size. If you have a list of `n` items, it will take a linear amount of time to process them.
   - **Example**: A **simple loop** that processes each element of an array once.

   ```python
   def find_max(arr):
       max_val = arr[0]
       for num in arr:
           if num > max_val:
               max_val = num
       return max_val

   # Example usage
   arr = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4]
   print(find_max(arr))  # Linear time to find the maximum
   ```

   - **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**

   **Explanation**: You have to look at each element once to find the maximum value, which takes linear time.

---

### 4. **O(n log n) â€“ Linearithmic Time**
   - **Meaning**: The algorithm's time grows as a combination of linear and logarithmic growth. This is typically found in efficient **sorting algorithms** like **Merge Sort** or **Quick Sort**.
   - **Example**: **Merge Sort**.

   ```python
   def merge_sort(arr):
       if len(arr) <= 1:
           return arr
       mid = len(arr) // 2
       left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
       right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
       return merge(left, right)

   def merge(left, right):
       result = []
       i = j = 0
       while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
           if left[i] < right[j]:
               result.append(left[i])
               i += 1
           else:
               result.append(right[j])
               j += 1
       result.extend(left[i:])
       result.extend(right[j:])
       return result

   # Example usage
   arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
   print(merge_sort(arr))  # Linearithmic time sort
   ```

   - **Time Complexity**: **O(n log n)**

   **Explanation**: The list is recursively divided in half (log n), and then the elements are merged (linear time for each level of recursion).

---

### 5. **O(nÂ²) â€“ Quadratic Time**
   - **Meaning**: The algorithm's time grows as the square of the input size. Typically, this occurs in algorithms with **nested loops**.
   - **Example**: **Bubble Sort**.

   ```python
   def bubble_sort(arr):
       n = len(arr)
       for i in range(n):
           for j in range(0, n-i-1):
               if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                   arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
       return arr

   # Example usage
   arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
   print(bubble_sort(arr))  # Quadratic time sorting
   ```

   - **Time Complexity**: **O(nÂ²)**

   **Explanation**: The algorithm uses two nested loops, where each loop iterates over the entire array, leading to quadratic time complexity.

### 6. **O(2^n) â€“ Exponential Time**
   - **Meaning**: The algorithm's time doubles with each additional input. This growth rate is **very slow** and typically impractical for larger inputs.
   - **Example**: Solving the **Fibonacci sequence** recursively.

   ```python
   def fibonacci(n):
       if n <= 1:
           return n
       return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

   # Example usage
   print(fibonacci(10))  # Exponential time for recursive Fibonacci
   ```

   - **Time Complexity**: **O(2^n)**

   **Explanation**: The function calls itself twice at each level, leading to an exponential number of calls as `n` increases.

---

### 7. **O(n!) â€“ Factorial Time**
   - **Meaning**: The algorithmâ€™s time grows as the factorial of the input size. This is **extremely slow** and is typically seen in problems like generating all permutations.
   - **Example**: Generating **permutations** of a string.

   ```python
   from itertools import permutations

   def generate_permutations(s):
       return list(permutations(s))

   # Example usage
   print(generate_permutations('abc'))  # Factorial time generation of permutations
   ```

   - **Time Complexity**: **O(n!)**

   **Explanation**: Generating all permutations of a string of length `n` results in `n!` possible combinations, which grows very quickly as `n` increases.

| **O(log n)**    | Logarithmic Time        | Time grows logarithmically (binary search).| `binary_search(arr)`    |
| **O(n)**        | Linear Time             | Time grows linearly with input size.      | `find_max(arr)`         |
| **O(n log n)**  | Linearithmic Time       | Combination of linear and logarithmic growth (sorting). | `merge_sort(arr)`        |
| **O(nÂ²)**       | Quadratic Time          | Time grows quadratically (nested loops).  | `bubble_sort(arr)`      |
| **O(2^n)**      | Exponential Time        | Time doubles with each additional input.  | `fibonacci(n)`          |
| **O(n!)**       | Factorial Time          | Time grows as factorial of input size.    | `generate_permutations('abc')` |
