### **Long Term Strategy to Excel at LeetCode (Updated)**

To excel at LeetCode and prepare for technical interviews, we‚Äôll use a **structured, pattern-focused, and adaptive** approach. This strategy leverages a divide-and-conquer methodology, prioritizes commonly tested problems, incorporates spaced repetition, and adapts to various workplace dynamics (healthy, toxic, etc.). The goal is to master algorithmic problem-solving, optimize for interviews, and build resilience for real-world scenarios.
