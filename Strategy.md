Below is an updated version of your initial **Long Term Strategy to Excel at LeetCode**, incorporating my feedback, enhancements, and insights while maintaining the core structure and intent of your original plan. The updates include:

1. **Spaced Repetition**: Added a system for revisiting problems to reinforce learning.
2. **Peer/Mentor Feedback**: Integrated opportunities for external review to improve code quality.
3. **Pattern-Focused Practice**: Emphasized mastering problem-solving patterns over sheer volume.
4. **Stress Simulation**: Included practice for toxic work environments to build resilience.
5. **Real-Time Insights**: Leveraged tools like X post analysis for trending topics.
6. **Emotional Resilience**: Added techniques to handle challenging workplace dynamics.
7. **Balanced Speed and Accuracy**: Adjusted daily practice to include speed drills and deep analysis.

The updated strategy retains your divide-and-conquer approach, detailed data structure/algorithm breakdown, and workplace contextualization (healthy, toxic, etc.), but it’s streamlined for clarity and enhanced with practical implementation steps. I’ve also included a sample weekly schedule and a section on tracking progress to make the plan actionable.
